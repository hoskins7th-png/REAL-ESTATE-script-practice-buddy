Q: Why should I list with you?
A: I’m both a licensed real estate broker AND a mortgage loan officer, so I fix the financing gap that killed your first listing and convert showings into real offers.

Q: I’m already relisting with my agent.
A: Loyalty is fine—but if the plan is the same (wait and drop price), you’ll get the same result; I relaunch with payment scenarios that make buyers act.

Q: I’m taking a break from selling.
A: Breaks don’t stop carrying costs; let me show you exactly why it didn’t sell and a 30-day fix so you don’t burn another $2–3K/month.

Q: The market is bad—nothing sells.
A: Homes near you are selling in 30–45 days; it wasn’t “the market,” it was missing affordability clarity—my specialty.

Q: I already dropped the price twice—I’m done.
A: Good—stop dropping; I show 2–3 financing paths (e.g., 2-1 buydown, FHA, conventional) so buyers pay your price with confidence.

Q: My home is fine; the agent was the problem.
A: Probably the strategy was; perfect photos don’t close buyers who can’t see the payment—finance-first positioning does.

Q: I don’t want another broker.
A: I’m not “another broker”—I’m broker + lender; I control marketing AND financing so deals don’t die at underwriting.

Q: I’ll just rent it out.
A: That’s a band-aid with tenant risk and management costs; I’d rather sell in 30–45 days and free your cash without landlord drama.

Q: I can’t afford another commission.
A: You’re already paying $2–3K/month to wait; a fast, financed sale often nets more than months of carry hoping to save a fee.

Q: I need to think about it.
A: Think with data, not guesswork—let me send a free breakdown of what blocked the sale and the exact fix, then decide.

Q: Buyers just aren’t out there.
A: They are—your showings proved it; they left without offering because they couldn’t map the monthly; I solve that on-page and in-person.

Q: I’m waiting for spring.
A: Spring brings more buyers—and 2x the competing listings; selling now with financing clarity often beats waiting and paying carry.

Q: My agent says “be patient.”
A: “Be patient” isn’t a plan; a new strategy is—finance-forward relaunch with pre-qualified buyers and payment options.

Q: Lenders always blow up my deals.
A: That’s why I pre-qualify before offers and quarterback the loan myself; fewer surprises, faster closings.

Q: How does a mortgage broker help me sell?
A: Price is a number; payment is a feeling—when I show buyers exactly how they can afford your home, hesitation turns into offers.
Q: I’m selling FSBO to save money.
A: Fair—but FSBOs often “save” commission and lose more in price cuts and delays. I keep your price firm by showing buyers clear payment options that turn interest into offers.

Q: I already have a few buyers interested.
A: Interest isn’t approval. I verify financing fit fast and present multiple payment paths so one of those “maybes” becomes a clean, funded offer.

Q: Buyers get their own financing—why do I need you?
A: Most buyers walk when they can’t picture the monthly. I show 2–3 payment scenarios (e.g., 2-1 buydown, FHA vs. conventional) so they can say yes at your price.

Q: I don’t want to pay extra fees.
A: You don’t. I’m paid by the buyer’s loan at closing. You get qualified showings and stronger offers without writing a check.

Q: I already work with a bank.
A: Great—keep them. I’m your Plan B for edge cases (self-employed, non-QM, portfolio loans) so good buyers aren’t turned away.

Q: I don’t have time for this right now.
A: Then you need screening. I pre-qualify buyers before they see your home so you do fewer showings with only real contenders.

Q: I’m not working with agents or brokers at all.
A: You stay FSBO. I’m not listing your home—I’m the financing arm that keeps deals from dying at underwriting while you keep control.

Q: My price is already sharp; I’ll sell without help.
A: Price isn’t the usual blocker—payment clarity is. Show buyers how your price fits their budget and you attract full-price offers without discounting.

Q: I’ll list with an agent if FSBO fails.
A: That’s a costly plan. First, eliminate the financing friction in 2–3 weeks; if it still doesn’t move, then consider listing.

Q: Buyers told me they’re pre-approved.
A: For some house—maybe not yours. HOA rules, appraisal, DTI, and program guidelines can kill deals. I confirm fit for your property upfront.

Q: I’ve sold FSBO before—I know what I’m doing.
A: Respect. The game changed—buydowns, lender credits, and program mixes are now the difference between “nice showing” and “new contract.”

Q: I don’t want to give you my buyers’ info.
A: Don’t. I provide a one-page affordability sheet you can hand out. Buyers contact me only if they want options. You keep control.

Q: This sounds too good to be true. What’s the catch?
A: No catch. I’m paid when a buyer’s loan closes. If you don’t sell, I don’t get paid—our incentives are aligned.

Q: If needed, I’ll just lower my price.
A: Cutting is a blunt tool. Clarity beats discounting: show a monthly number buyers can handle, and you keep more equity without racing to the bottom.

Q: Buyers only care about deals, not loan options.
A: Buyers care about certainty. When they see a payment they can live with, “we’ll think about it” turns into “we’re writing.”
